    <p id="para1" class="mytext"><q>Hypertext</q> refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together.
        Thus, the link available on a webpage is called <i>Hypertext</i>.
        HTML is a <b><i>Markup Language</i></b> which means you use HTML to simply <u>"mark-up"</u> a text document with
        tags that tell a Web
        browser how to structure it to display.</p>
